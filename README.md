# SimplyDailyTaker
Welcome in my Daily Taker which is working on hellcase.com

#INSTALLATION#
1. Download Python 3.6 
2. Download ChromeDriver from: https://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/index.html?path=2.36/
3. In my VM i have it on desktop so i don't need to change any PATH in Hellcase.py 
4. Now you have to open Hellcase.py and edit line 11 by your profile PATH. You have to open chrome://version and just copy Profile Path.
5. You should login into your steam account because there is no steam autologin included. 
6. Save by pressing CTRL+S.
Don't forget that you need to have 'hellcase.com' in your profile name, after logging in you can delete 'hellcase.com' from your name.
7. Now you can run the script and enjoy free money without doing anything.
